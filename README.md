# Deep_Classifier

Deep learning project for subcortical segmentation classification. The aim is the automatic detection of incorrect segmentations to be included as a quality control (QC) step in the whole processing pipeline. The dataset is composed of brain MRI sequences where different corpus callosum segmentations (automatic, semi-automatic, and manual) were obtained and used for training and testing the algorithm.
